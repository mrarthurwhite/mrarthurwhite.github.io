I ran into the following interview by a flatiron student (ex student) and resonated with it:

> I started my job hunt in early February. I applied to hundreds of jobs in the market using such sites as Glassdoor, LinkedIn etc, and heard back from 10 companies and finally landed an offer. From time to time, I was very emotional after I spent the whole night trying to finish a technical task for an application and then ended up with a rejection a few days later. I had moments of self doubt that I wasn't good enough to be a data scientist. But I believe everything is meaningful. A technical project might not have converted into an offer, however, it enhanced newly-honed knowledge.*

If we are CS professionals we ought to perhaps  not have to code for free on basic but laborious tests. 


We would like all the advantages and none of the disadvantages of every aspect be it civilized life or uncivilized (organic) lifestyles.
