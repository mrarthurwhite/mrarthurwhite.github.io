I ran into the following interview by a flatiron student (ex student) and resonated with it:

> * I started my job hunt in early February. I applied to hundreds of jobs in the market using such sites as Glassdoor, LinkedIn etc, and heard back from 10 companies and finally landed an offer. From time to time, I was very emotional after I spent the whole night trying to finish a technical task for an application and then ended up with a rejection a few days later. I had moments of self doubt that I wasn't good enough to be a data scientist. But I believe everything is meaningful. A technical project might not have converted into an offer, however, it enhanced newly-honed knowledge.*
>  

I too have recently faced such treatment. Certain companies would ask me to give a "test" to "prove you can code" (astounding since I have 8+ years of development experience and two degrees in the field of computer engineering & mathematics/statics/ computer vision & machine learning, specifically) from the top universities (the leading universities of the world). 

After acing the test sometimes the recruiter would ghost me (or never get back to me). When I was invited to a plant visit I would have to sit down and hand hold and explain to my interviewer basic concepts (like recursion at a major investment bank) not because the interviewer wanted to know if I knew, but because the interviewer did not know the answer. I have had to explain C++ pointer arithematic to an interviewer who was asking me C++ questions but herself didn't know the language. I have had to explain mathematical proofs with interviewers who had given me "customized" tests which I had to correct for bugs. In all cases I did not get a job offer and I spent a great deal of effort & time on these interviews.

The above approach to interviewing candidates *may* make sense if the candidate has neither education nor experience but it does not make sense if the candidate has both or one of the above (education or experience). Why? because as professionals we are supposed to be paid for our time and effort. We cannot be asked to give tests (anyone can throw random tests that are basic but laborious) and then spend hours coding/solving tests to the detriment of our own personal progress - only to receive a rejection at the end or silence. 

One Russian CEO refused to explain to me why he did not approve of my source code and just smiled. The code worked &  it had a moderate level of complexity & library use but instead of pointing to me what he disapproved of he insulted me and my work without explaining himself (as to weaknesses or deficiencies he saw). 

Why is this happening? I attend universities where students work hard & learn relevant good (nay great) material - some of it far more sublime than any mathematics or engineering or science. When they show up for interviews they simply have to say "I am interested in this field" and they are offered the job. My resume includes work at mid to large/global firms. I have had offers in the 6 figures from top 3 firms and every single one of them involved behavioral interviews. A pleasant conversation and an offer is made. 

The companies who asked me to "prove I can code" by giving out CS 101 questions do not have a very high score in giving offers to me. It was almost as if they had made up their mind before they asked me to tutor them in computer science. One such FAANG company repeatedly emails me every month to a quarter asking to interview me (most recent email datedd April 13 2020). 

**If we are CS professionals we ought to be able to paid for the time we spend on their tests. This might discourage them from being cavalier about asking people to give tests on the interviewer's time. 
**

This reminds me of the use and abuse in the entertainment industry where "struggling artists" are asked to "audition" and then dismissed without explanation or feedback. However, we are not actors - with minimal schooling & just a desire to "inhabit" questionable characters (considering the state of the arts wholesome is hard to find). As Robert Downey Jr said "give me any man on the street and I will make him a movie star in 36 hours" ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnoItCi32Y)). Acting is not the same as engineering sciences which takes years of study & in the case of software engineering which require a few months of intensive training  (as with a bootcamp) people still ought not to be treated so (be it acting or engineering). 

**Why is this happening?**

That is the real question. Here are some theories
1) did some novice attending a bootcamp go "well I had to go through so many tests & rejections , why shouldn't everyone else?"
2) did some actor say, "well I go through so many unkind auditions, everyone should"?
3) the interview above is from a lady from Asia based out of London. There is concern that population over flow and over crowding is making everything not-easy for everyone else. I was told this by a gentleman from India who said, "ease of obtaining jobs in tech from foreigners overseas is not good for those of us who are already here". I was aghast at his protectionist views. But if this is true, then the idea behind work & materialism & capitalism is to make the life of everyone easy not to import the desperation, competitiveness & hardships of 3rd world countries. A gentleman from China for example told me that he was immigrating to Canada because schools are difficult to get admissions into in China. I sympathised with him and welcomed and congratulated him & still feel all folk must get all the help so they become fair, beautiful, prosperous, free and everything good. 
4) was this inevitable because people in the engineering sciences are rarely white and rarely good looking? I can understand looks being a matter of national importance in acting (I am sincere here) and even in customer facing roles, but our work primarily involves interacting with LCD screens. Is the idea to squeeze unattractive people out of the gene pool or is it to beautify us ? if it is to beautify us then stress and random tests and rejection is not good for anyone's skin (or hair or health). Therefore it is likely this mistreatment is to inform the undesirable elements (who could not make it to business school or law school or acting school) that it would have been better to choose the gas chamber over this slow, debilitating, subtle, indirect administration of hardship. I personally have gotten the point and refuse to have children until I resemble Armie Hammer & meet a lady who resembles his gorgeous wife, but there are plenty of individuals from 3rd world countries who are adamant about birthing children in the pollution , famine & overcrowding just to spite the beautiful & the wealthy (and I think that is even worse than choosing the gas chamber). 

There are plenty of people from 3rd world countries who are willing to take as many tests as are thrown at them because life in 3rd world countries simply is much worse & they have little to lose. 

Who is impacted most by such hardship? it is perhaps mostly the delicate, fragile, comely, fair , beautiful , white folk who are trying to rise from a life of living from paycheck to paycheck (you know those termed as white "tr-sh" and the blue collar worker). Why do I say this ? I see in my own cohort at flatiron the first to fall from the cohort were white ladies with tattooes living in the middle of nowhere (and sometimes with children). The only people remaining are hardened people from the equatorial / tropical belt (Latinos, Africans, Asians) or ethnic minorities some of whom are desperately coloring their hair blonde in anticipation of the interviewing phase (or perhaps a kind word from others in the cohort or the teachers). That and the few white gentlemen who always astound me in their brilliance , insight and natural talent with things be it musical instruments or computer keyboards or legal & philosophical precepts or economic ideas etc. Truly geniuses who are perhaps motivated by a spirit similar to the one that found the Jews in the desert when they were asked to build the ark though they had no training or background.
