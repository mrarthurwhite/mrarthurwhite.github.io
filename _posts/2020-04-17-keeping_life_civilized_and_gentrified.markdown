I ran into the following interview by a flatiron student (ex student) and resonated with it:

> I started my job hunt in early February. I applied to hundreds of jobs in the market using such sites as Glassdoor, LinkedIn etc, and heard back from 10 companies and finally landed an offer. From time to time, I was very emotional after I spent the whole night trying to finish a technical task for an application and then ended up with a rejection a few days later. I had moments of self doubt that I wasn't good enough to be a data scientist. But I believe everything is meaningful. A technical project might not have converted into an offer, however, it enhanced newly-honed knowledge.*
>  

I know people who have recently faced such treatment. Certain companies would ask them to give a "test" to "prove you can code" (astounding since some of these people have had 8+ years of development experience and several graduate degrees in the field of computer engineering & mathematics/statistics/ computer vision & machine learning, specifically) from the top universities (the leading universities of the world). 

After acing the test sometimes the recruiter would ghost them (or never get back to them). When one of them was invited to a plant visit they would have to sit down and hand hold and explain to their interviewer basic concepts (like recursion at a major investment bank) not because the interviewer wanted to know if the interviewee knew, but because the interviewer did not know how to implement it themselves. Some of us have had to explain C++ pointer arithematic to an interviewer who was asking  C++ questions ( questions taken from an online interviewing site) but themselves didn't know the language. They have had to explain mathematical proofs to interviewers who had given them "customized" tests which the interviewee had to first declare an errata on then correct the bugs inthe test (to the delight of other employees in the company who did not like the interviewer). In all cases they did not get a job offer despite acing them (programming tasks are easily verified) and spent a great deal of effort & time on these interviews.

The above approach to interviewing candidates *may* make sense if the candidate has neither education nor experience but it does not make sense if the candidate has both or one of the above (education or experience). Why? because as professionals we are supposed to be paid for our time and effort. We cannot be asked to give tests (anyone can throw random tests that are basic but laborious) and then spend hours coding/solving tests to the detriment of our own  progress - only to receive a rejection at the end or silence. 

One CIO/ CEO refused to explain to an interviewee why he did not approve of his source code and just smiled. The code worked &  it had a moderate level of complexity & library use but instead of pointing to the interviewee what the evaluator disapproved of they insulted him &  his work without explaining themselves (as to weaknesses or deficiencies they saw)- again the interviewee had multiple graduate degrees in the field *and* software engineering experience for years & offers from top firms . 

Why is this happening? What is the norm? I have been fortunate enough to attend universities where students work hard & learn relevant good (nay great) material - some of it far more sublime than any mathematics or engineering or science. When they show up for interviews they simply have to say "I am interested in this field" and they are offered the 7 figure job. Their resumes includes work at mid to large/global firms. They have had offers in the 6 figures from top 3 firms in the field and every single one of them involved behavioral interviews. A pleasant conversation and an offer is made, that is normal in white collar professions. 

The companies who asked interviewees to "prove you can code" by giving out CS 101 questions do not have a very high score in giving offers, perhaps. It was almost as if they had made up their mind before they asked my friend to tutor them in computer science. One such FAANG company repeatedly emails my friend every month to a quarter asking to interview him (most recent email dated April 13 2020). 


If we are CS professionals we ought to perhaps  not have to code for free on basic but laborious tests. 




**Why is this happening?**

That is the real question. Here are some theories


1) did some novice attending a bootcamp go "well I had to go through so many tests & rejections , why shouldn't everyone else?"

2) did some actor say, "well I go through so many unkind auditions, everyone should"?

3) the interview above is from a lady from Asia based out of London. There is concern that population over flow and over crowding is making everything not-easy for everyone else. I was told this by a gentleman from India who said, "ease of obtaining jobs in tech by foreigners overseas is not good for those of us who are already here". I was aghast at his protectionist views. But if this is true, then the idea behind work & materialism & capitalism is to make the life of everyone easy not to import the desperation, competitiveness & hardships of 3rd world countries. A gentleman from China for example told me that he was immigrating to Canada because schools are difficult to get admissions into in China. I sympathised with him and welcomed and congratulated him & still feel all folk must get all the help so they become fair, beautiful, prosperous, free and everything good - and we hope everyone learns from this and practices population management so people don't have to flee overcrowding & then end up importing it elsewhere. 


4) was this increase in hardship inevitable because people in the engineering sciences (specifically IT/software engineering) are from ethnic groups & perhaps not considered very good looking? (atleast in light of the decades long influx from overseas) I can understand looks being a matter of national importance in acting (I am sincere here) and even in customer facing roles, but our work primarily involves interacting with LCD screens. 


Is the idea to beautify us or is it to make us realize truths ? if it is to beautify us then stress and random tests and rejection is not good for anyone's skin (or hair or health). Therefore it is likely this treatment is to inform the undesirable elements (who could not make it to business school or law school or acting school) that it would have been better to choose the heaven over this slow, debilitating, subtle, indirect administration of hardship. 

I personally have decided in favor of beauty before reproduction, but there are some individuals from 3rd world countries who are adamant about birthing children in the pollution , famine & overcrowding perhaps just to spite the beautiful & the wealthy (and I think that is  worse than choosing a quick end).  If we are not beautiful inside or outside , if we lack in virtue inside or outside then a quick end would be preferable to this inequity.


Despite this inequity, there are some people from 3rd world countries who are willing to take as many tests as are thrown at them because life in 3rd world countries simply is much worse & they have little to lose. 


Who is impacted most by such hardship? it is perhaps mostly the delicate, fragile, comely, fair , beautiful  folk who are trying to rise from a life of living from paycheck to paycheck (you know those termed as white "tr-sh" and the blue collar worker). 

Why do I say this ?

I see in my own cohort at flatiron (where they actually make an effort to make things easy & accessible) the first to fall from the cohort were  ladies with tattooes living in the middle of nowhere (and sometimes with children). The only people remaining are hardened people from the equatorial / tropical belt (Latinos, Africans, Asians) or ethnic minorities some of whom are desperately coloring their hair blonde in anticipation of the interviewing phase (or perhaps a kind word from others in the cohort or the teachers).

 That and the few fair gentlemen who always astound me in their brilliance , insight and natural talent with things be it musical instruments or computer keyboards or legal & philosophical precepts or economic ideas etc. Truly geniuses who are perhaps motivated by a spirit similar to the one that found the Jews in the desert when they were asked to build the ark though they had no training or background.
