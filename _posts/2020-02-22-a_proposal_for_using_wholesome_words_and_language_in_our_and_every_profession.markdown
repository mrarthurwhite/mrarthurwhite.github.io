I am certain people realize how important it is to avoid the useof profanities or obscenities. If Software Engineering (& Engineering Science) is a white collar profession with gentlemen and ladies engaging in this profession then we ought to avoid unwholesome, non-benign words, images, work & consequently creations, inventions. 

I and perhaps many others are uncomfortable with acronyms like "Create.Read.Update.Delete". The word "cr-d" is a scatological term used in the South (I believe, specifically the lovely state of Tennessee where I first heard it) and is definitely a profane term. May we perhaps use something else ?  maybe something like "curd" - a delicious synonym for yogurt ? 

Other terms that are epithets are "git" (in England it is a pejorative term and people use it when verbally abusing people). May we use something like "get" (to denote getting from a source control repository?). 

Other unwholesome , non benign images in the profession are terms like "p-thon" an animal that is definitely non benign & unwholesome (and is the name of a language). May we perhaps invoke images of doves & butterflies instead perhaps? 

I invite my esteemed colleagues to raise the level of dialogue in our profession and help create a more beautiful, fair, comely, lovely, loving, kinder, prosperous , easy world for all.
