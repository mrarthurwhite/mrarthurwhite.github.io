This is perhaps the first step for every beginner. Most professionals already have advanced and even proprietary Integrated Development Environments (IDE) set up. Examples of popular IDEs are Eclipse, NetBeans, JetBrains, Atom, Visual Studio (Microsoft). 

However, sometimes beginners are discouraged by the misguided with regards to an IDE. It is however most important for beginners to have an IDE set up before they write a single line of code. Why? because an IDE is like a tutor, mentor, helper which holds your hand and guides you during software engineering or scientific endeavors. It helps point out missing semicolons and any errors in your syntax or minor oversights like the incorrect keyword use. It identifies these things and provides you with templates which a beginner needs in the beginning (because it is not recommended to memorize anything unless its Holy Scripture or Homer which were one and the same a long time ago, but really, particularly syntax and coding conventions ought never to be memorized by an engineer or scientist or inventor, because engineering/science/invention is above all a creative endeavor & not a mechanical one).

When the beginner becomes a professional then the professional needs the tools to avoid tedium. There are some processes which ought to be automated as soon as possible and the engineer freed to think creative, innovative solutions (not struggling with set up and mechanics & syntax).

Although the institution supports VS Code set up I was helped by one of the students from a long-time, trustworthy & loyal US ally : Pakistan in setting up the IDE for RubyMine (a JetBrains IDE) which comes free for students. The gentleman was not in my cohort but was helpful nonetheless (as I have found the many peoples from all over the world) and for that I am grateful. What he identified was that the instructions for setting up VS Code are already given here [1](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/wsl-setup)

If you go to the section on setting up a terminal you will see:

In the above section step 15 you are asked to choose the default shell & that is what you can set up with your RubyMine or any other IDE.

How to do it in RubyMine? Just go to File (in the menu) then Settings then Tools then Terminal. Or just search settings for "terminal" and enter the path to your wsl.exe file.

Best of luck to all.
