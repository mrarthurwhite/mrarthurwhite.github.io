I was going over a lab designed by flatiron and I came to the part where the mood of the pets changes from "happy" to "nervous" when they are sold. I never thought that could happen to a life form because I have never had pets or been around pets by the grace of the Most High God. It shook me, made me pause and made me terribly unhappy and upset.

I felt rather unhappy and I thought I ought to mention that life forms are not to be "bought" and "sold" and none may have "owners" . For we all are children or creations of the Most High God (if God exists for those who may not believe in a God).

Every life form perhaps ought to have freedom and open range roaming . Our role as intelligent life forms is perhaps not to own these lovely creatures but to restore them to innocence. Our role is perhaps to prevent other life forms from harming one another so a day comes when the lion too eats hay and lays with the lamb (as in this ancient text that is adored by many).

Love towards all life ** & matter** is important. If you have seen toy story you will realize that even inanimate matter has feelings and we ought to treat inanimate matter (our beloved toys) with gentle, ardent , sensitive love.

For those who are lonesome or afflicted and "need" pets or who are "found" by pets, our role is perhaps to emancipate, empower, heal, love, edify all life and all matter. Only light and love and peace for all.

The above I shared with my respected colleagues (cohort mates) and I also share with the world.
