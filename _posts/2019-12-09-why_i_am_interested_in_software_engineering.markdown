I am interested in software engineering because it helps me to create useful , good creations for the benefit of all matter.

I had ideas about hardware and software projects but they seem to be mostly in prototype stage until someone else brings them to the market (after which I just watch forlornly from afar).


I am interested in other aspects of life like storytelling, acting, filmmaking, philosophy etc.
I am hoping every part of my life and matter beautifies me inside and out to permit me to be gorgeous, to love (and be loved), to prosper myself (and others) and live life to the fullest and to the most beautiful extent.
