I am interested in software engineering because it helps me to create useful , good creations for the benefit of all matter.

I have ideas about  projects which I hope to turn into global, multi billion dollar entities. 

 I am interested in other aspects of life like storytelling, acting, filmmaking, philosophy etc. 

As I complete my Masters in Management from Harvard I aim to become an investment banker (perhaps a managing director) primarily because of the nature of the work.

In the interim I am using my BS in Computer Engineering from UIUC & my MS from Columbia Univ. in Machine Learning & Computer Vision to find software engineering work, so I may remain free, virtuous, independent of impious influences and vices.  I look forward to interviewing like civilized people where offers are made after a pleasant conversation and things are easy & there is general attempt to beautify, improve , love, edify all matter. I am grateful that I am fortunate to be surrounded by a peoples (a nation, a hemisphere and a world) where people  make each other beautiful, comely, fair, wealthy, free, happy & prosperous so they may live and love & prosper.

 If we are not attractive enough then make us so. If we are not attractive enough because there is something wrong with our morality or spirit then give us the right spirit and morality. If we are not good enough to embrace the right spirit or morality then give us a quick end but let us be as fair as the fairest & live the highest quality of life , the best quality of life in love with the fairest & most beautiful of folk. If we don't meet those requirements there are no excuses for punitive measures (physical harm, race- harm, harm to sexuality, harm to finances, harm to familial relations, harm to dignity & freedoms). 


I am hoping every part of my life and matter beautifies me inside and out to permit me to be gorgeous, to love (and be loved), to prosper myself (and others) and live life to the fullest and to the most beautiful extent.

I am grateful that we can all learn programming languages but I hope one day we can also learn human languages like German, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Russian etc. so we may communicate with the fairest of human beings in mutual love, affection, edification, joy.  Yes, the fairest, most loving human beings are the preference of even us outsiders, apparently (by the grace of God).

Some people may say that we engineers are not good looking enough to spend our days interacting with, loving & rejoicing with other beautiful human beings and therefore must spend time staring into LCD screens. If that is the case then may we too become beautiful inside & outside As Schiller said "Es ist der Geist, der sich den KÃ¶rper baut" (Its the spirit that makes the body/face beautiful). May we too be as beautiful as Schiller & his beautiful peoples . So we may converse with the Pope in Latin, in German with Toni Garn (& Pope Benedict), in Hebrew with Bar Rafaeli, our Jewish friends (& God), read Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus & Plutarch in Greek (as well as the New Testament) etc. & see the beauty of the fair Russian peoples in their language.
