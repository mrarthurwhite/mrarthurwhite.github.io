I am interested in software engineering because it helps me to create useful , good creations for the benefit of all matter.

I had ideas about hardware and software projects but they seem to be mostly in prototype stage until someone else brings them to the market (after which I just watch forlornly from afar).


I am interested in other aspects of life like storytelling, acting, filmmaking, philosophy etc.
I am hoping every part of my life and matter beautifies me inside and out to permit me to be gorgeous, to love (and be loved), to prosper myself (and others) and live life to the fullest and to the most beautiful extent.

I am grateful that we can all learn programming languages but I hope one day we can also learn human languages like German, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Russian etc. so we may communicate with other human beings in mutual love, affection, edification, joy. 
Some people may say that we engineers are not good looking enough to spend our days interacting with, loving & rejoicing with other beautiful human beings. If that is the case then may we too become beautiful inside & outside As Schiller said "Es ist der Geist, der sich den KÃ¶rper baut" (Its the spirit that makes the body/face beautiful). May we too be as beautiful as Schiller & his beautiful peoples . So we may converse with the Pope in Latin, in German with Toni Garn in German (& Pope Benedict), in Hebrew with Bar Rafaeli, our Jewish friends (& God), read Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus & Plutarch in Greek (as well as the New Testament) etc. & see the beauty of the fair Russian peoples in their language.
